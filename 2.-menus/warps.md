# 2.1 Warps

#### Locations

The **locations** menu provides a list of every room in the game and allows you to warp directly to them. There are three different values for this:

* **area**: Rooms grouped together by location, such as Toad Town, Dry Dry Desert, Flower Fields, etc.
* **map**: The specific map in the selected area, typically accessed by a loading zone.
* **entrance**: Where the map will be accessed from. This is mostly for selecting a loading zone, but certain entrances are also used to start cutscenes. The general rule of thumb is that earlier entrances are for loading zones and later entrances are for cutscenes.

After selecting an area, map, and entrance, selecting `warp` will immediately warp you to your selected destination. This works even if you are in battle.

#### Bosses

The **bosses** menu provides a list of every major, minor, and optional boss in the game. By selecting a boss, you will warp to the room that the boss is located in, and your story progress and any necessary flags will be set to allow you to fight the boss, regardless of your current state.

Also note that when warping directly to Bowser's second phase, because the game normally carries Bowser's HP over from the first phase, a menu to select his starting HP is provided.
