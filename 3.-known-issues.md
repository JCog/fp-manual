# 3. Known Issues

There are a few known issues with fp without an easy fix:

* When using the automatic timer, riding Laki or Sushie counts as one long cutscene. This means things that would normally increment the cutscene counter, such as going through a loading zone, no longer will.
* In rare circumstances when using the free camera, the game may crash.
* Occasionally when going through the first Bowser door in Chapter 8, the game will crash.
* Some SD cards don't seem to work on Wii VC.
* Wii U is still a work in progress with minimal testing and is provided as is.
