# 1. Introduction

The main interface for interacting with fp is the utility menu, which can be accessed by pressing `R + D-Up`. This menu can be navigated with the D-pad, and L is used to make a selection. To quickly go back a menu, press `R + D-Left`. To close the menu, press `R + D-Up` again. These button combos can also be configured (see [Settings](2.-menus/2.9-settings.md)).

If starting from a new file, it's advisable to play mostly normally until at least obtaining Goombario. Until that point, the game isn't quite in a state that expects you to be able to go anywhere but the starting areas, and you'll likely run into crashing issues.
