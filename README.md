# 1. Installation

fp supports both the US and JP versions of Paper Mario on N64, Wii, and Wii U. Use the [web patcher](https://fp-patcher.starhaven.dev/) to install the latest version. For legal reasons, you must provide a copy of the base game yourself.

* **N64:** Provide an N64 ROM in big-endian, little-endian, or byte-swapped format.
* **Wii:** Provide a `.wad` file. A separate N64 ROM isn't required as the patcher will use the one in the WAD.
* **Wii U:** Provide decrypted game data packed in either a `.zip` or `.tar` file. This should include `code`, `content`, and `meta` folders. They do not need to be in the root of the archive, but they must all be in the same folder.
